#+TITLE: Tims XMonad Config

After living in dwm for quite a long time, [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg][DistroTube]] got me interested in XMonad, Haskell and functional programming altogether.

This repository shares the config i'm currently using. I hope, that i can keep it up to date.

Note, that the file =EqualSpacing.hs= is work of [[https://github.com/egasimus][egaismus]] and wasn't written by myself. I work under Arch Linux and have the packages =xmonad-git= and =xmonad-contrib-git= installed in order to live on the bleeding edge as easily as possible. The files are formatted using [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brittany][brittany]]. I try to right the things correctly, but keep in mind, that i've only just begun working with functional programming languages and Haskell in particular.

If you have any tips of improvement, please reach out to me.
